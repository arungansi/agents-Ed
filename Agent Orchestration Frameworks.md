# Agent Orchestration Frameworks & OpenAI SDK Alternatives (2025)

## 1. Alternatives to OpenAI SDK in 2025

Several alternatives to the OpenAI SDK are available for integrating large language models and generative AI into applications:

- **Google Gemini API**: Access to Gemini models, REST and Python SDKs, supports text, code, and multimodal inputs.
- **Anthropic Claude API**: Claude 3 and later models, Python/Node.js/REST support, focus on safety and long-context.
- **Microsoft Azure AI Studio**: Offers GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo, Meta Llama, Mistral, Cohere models, SDKs for Python, JS, .NET.
- **Meta Llama API**: Llama 3 and future models, REST API and Python SDK, open weights for self-hosting.
- **Mistral AI**: Mistral and Mixtral models, REST API and Python SDK, open-source focus.
- **Cohere API**: Command R and others, REST/Python/Node.js SDKs, RAG emphasis.
- **AWS Bedrock**: Unified API for Anthropic, AI21, Cohere, Meta, Amazon Titan, SDKs for Python, JS, Java.
- **Ollama**: Local deployment of open-source models, CLI and REST API.

## 2. Why CrewAI is Not an Alternative to OpenAI SDK

- **CrewAI** is not a foundational model provider or API for LLMs.
- It is an **agent orchestration framework** for building, managing, and coordinating multiple AI agents.
- CrewAI often uses OpenAI SDK (or similar) as a backend for its agents.
- **Summary:** CrewAI is for multi-agent systems, not direct LLM access.

## 3. Alternatives to CrewAI

Popular alternatives for agent orchestration and multi-agent frameworks:

- **LangChain Agents**: Agent-based workflows, supports multiple LLMs, Python/JS.
- **AutoGen (Microsoft)**: Multi-agent conversations, complex collaboration, Python.
- **MetaGPT**: Collaborative problem-solving, software engineering focus, Python.
- **Haystack Agents**: RAG and agent pipelines, integrates with various LLMs, Python.
- **OpenAgents**: Open-source platform for agentic workflows, supports multiple LLMs.

## 4. Agent Orchestration Frameworks with Open Source Developer UI Studio

Frameworks providing open-source developer UI studios:

- **LangChain (LangChainHub & LangSmith)**: LangChainHub (open-source UI), LangSmith (open/paid tiers).
- **AutoGen Studio**: Open-source web UI for multi-agent workflows.
- **Haystack (Haystack UI)**: Open-source UI for agent pipelines and RAG.
- **OpenAgents**: Open-source web UI for agentic workflows.

---

## 5. Why CrewAI UI Studio is Not Considered an Alternative

- **CrewAI UI Studio is not open source** (as of 2025).
- It is proprietary and tightly coupled to CrewAI, not supporting other frameworks or LLMs natively.
- Open-source UIs (AutoGen Studio, Haystack UI, LangChainHub) are extensible, auditable, and integrable.

## 6. CrewAI Open Source Framework

- **CrewAI (open-source)**: Python framework for multi-agent systems, open source, supports various LLMs.
- **CrewAI UI Studio**: Proprietary, not open source.
- **Summary:** CrewAI framework is open source and code-based; for open-source visual UIs, consider AutoGen Studio or Haystack UI.
